# Employment-to-population ratio (potential) blog post

This repository contains the materials (minus the original CPS datafile) 
to try to recreate Brookings' blog post on employment gaps and 
recovering from the great recession. Specifically, this chart:

In the blog they go mention that this blog post is somewhat related to, 
but approached differently as, [The Closing of the Jobs Gap: A Decade of 
Recession and 
Recovery](www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/the_closing_of_the_jobs_gap_a_decade_of_recession_and_recovery)
